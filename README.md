# React Task Tracker
This is a task tracker built using react. It is based off of Brad Traversy's [React JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8).
I followed this tutorial to help me better understand how to use React and React components. It has also been a great tutorial on using and manipulating state using useState. It has no backend database so currently data does not persist but I plan on adding an express server and mongodb database.
